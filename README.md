# Django Real-Time Chat Application

A real-time chat application built using **Django**, **Django Channels**, and **WebSockets**. 
This project demonstrates the integration of a Django backend with WebSocket-based real-time communication and a responsive frontend.

## Overview

The application allows users to:

- Authenticate and manage user sessions.
- View multiple chat threads.
- Send and receive messages in real time without refreshing the page.
- Maintain separate chat sessions between different users.

It uses Djangoâ€™s ORM for database interactions, Django Channels for WebSocket handling, and Bootstrap for frontend interactivity.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Built using Django's built-in authentication system.
- **Chat Threads:** Each conversation between two users is stored as a `Thread`.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Messages are sent and received instantly using WebSockets.
- **Responsive UI:** Frontend uses Bootstrap for layout and styling.
- **Message History:** Past messages are fetched from the database and displayed in chronological order.

## Architecture 

1. **Models**  
   - `User`: Represents the authenticated user.  
   - `Thread`: Represents a chat conversation between two users.  
   - `ChatMessage`: Represents a single message in a thread.

2. **WebSocket Handling**  
   - **Consumers** handle WebSocket connections, receiving and broadcasting messages.  
   - **Routing** defines the WebSocket URL patterns mapped to consumers.  
   - **Channel Layers** (InMemory or Redis) allow message passing between consumers.

3. **Frontend**  
   - HTML templates render chat threads and message containers.  
   - jQuery handles DOM manipulation, form submission, and WebSocket events.  
   - Messages are dynamically appended to the chat window upon receiving via WebSocket.

4. **Backend**  
   - Django views handle authentication, thread listing, and message retrieval.  
   - The ASGI server (Daphne or Uvicorn) handles asynchronous communication for WebSockets.

## Setup

1. **Environment**  
   - Python 3.10+  
   - Django 4.x  
   - Django Channels 4.x  
   - Optional: Redis for production channel layer

2. **Static Files**  
   - CSS and JS are stored in the `static` directory.  
   - Messages and threads are dynamically rendered in templates.

3. **Running the Application**  
   - Start ASGI server (Daphne or Uvicorn).  
   - Navigate to `/` and log in.  
   - Click a contact to open a thread and start chatting.  

## Key Files and Directories

- `chat/models.py`: Defines `Thread` and `ChatMessage`.  
- `chat/consumers.py`: WebSocket consumer logic.  
- `chat/routing.py`: Maps WebSocket URLs to consumers.  
- `chat/templates/`: Contains HTML templates.  
- `chat/static/`: Contains JS, CSS, and images.  
- `chatproj/asgi.py`: ASGI configuration for WebSocket support.  

---

## Potential Challenges

- **WebSocket Connection:** Ensure ASGI server is running and the endpoint is correctly configured.  
- **Static File Loading:** Verify that `STATIC_URL` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` are configured correctly.  
- **User Authentication:** WebSocket consumers must check the authenticated user before sending messages.  

## Usage Flow

1. User logs in.  
2. User selects a chat thread from the contact list.  
3. WebSocket connection is established to the thread-specific endpoint.  
4. Messages sent are broadcasted to the thread in real-time.  
5. New messages are appended to the chat window without page reload.

## Conclusion

This Django Chat Application demonstrates how to combine **traditional Django views** with **real-time WebSocket communication** using Django Channels. 
It is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easily extendable with features like group chat, file sharing, or notifications.
